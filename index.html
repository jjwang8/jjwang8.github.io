      <!-- ABOUT / RESEARCH SUMMARY -->
      <section id="about">
        <h2>Research</h2>
        <p>
          I am broadly interested in architectural mechanisms that enable <strong>genuine reasoning</strong> in neural networks and large language models, where models perform internal structured computation like search, verification, and planning rather than surface-level pattern matching.
        </p>
        <p>
          My current work focuses on <strong>activation-free polynomial networks</strong> and transformer-style backbones with multiplicative interactions in place of standard nonlinearities, studying how design choices such as cross-receptive-field fusion, normalization, and depth shape what structures models can efficiently learn and how robustly they generalize.
          In parallel, I work on <strong>RLHF-style alignment with noisy preference data</strong>, exploring training schemes that explicitly evaluate and weight the reliability of learning signals instead of treating all feedback as equally trustworthy.
        </p>
        <p class="note">
          <!-- You can tweak this last sentence to match your exact future plans -->
          Going forward, I aim to design compact recurrent “reasoning cores” and world-model-based agents that can perform internal simulation, self-critique, and tool-using problem solving in open-ended environments.

          <p>
            Designing convolutional and transformer-style backbones built from polynomial and multiplicative units instead of standard activations (e.g., ReLU, softmax), with a focus on cross-receptive-field fusion, normalization strategies, and depth scaling.
            I evaluate these models on ImageNet and distribution shift benchmarks to study robustness and inductive biases.

        <p>
          I am currently preparing applications for PhD programs in computer science, with a focus on deep learning, reasoning-centric architectures, and alignment.
          Outside of research, I enjoy building systems and tools that make large-scale experimentation and data processing easier.
